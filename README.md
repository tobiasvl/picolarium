Picolarium
==========

Picolarium is a [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) clone of the game _Polarium_ for DS and GBA.

Draw a single stroke, flip tiles from black to white or vice versa, and make horizontal lines of the same colour.

There are 100 levels, and each level has a hint if you're stumped.

Custom levels
-------------

The game contains a level editor, which lets you create your own levels (20 can be saved at a time) and share them with others through 30-digit passwords (compatible with _Polarium_ and _Polarium Advance_).

You can also input passwords to play other people's custom levels. There are some custom levels online you can challenge yourself with:
